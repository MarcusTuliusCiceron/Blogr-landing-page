## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first Built the Header section. I build desktop style first then mobile. For the desktop style I decided to add an event listener on the whole page so the user will be able to close the dropdown nav menu by clicking anywhere outside the menu.
For the mobile hamburger menu I use the details landmark that allow to build an accordeon whithout js.

Rest of the page is pretty standard layout
